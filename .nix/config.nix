  ## If you have write access to one of these caches you can
  ## provide the auth token or signing key through a secret
  ##Â variable on GitHub. Then, you should give the variable
  ## name here. For instance, coq-community projects can use
  ## the following line instead of the one above:
  # cachix.coq-community.authToken = "CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN";

  ## Or if you have a signing key for a given Cachix cache:
  # cachix.my-cache.signingKey = "CACHIX_SIGNING_KEY"

  ## Note that here, CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN and CACHIX_SIGNING_KEY
  ## are the names of secret variables. They are set in
  ## GitHub's web interface.
