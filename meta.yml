  Mechanization of the Four Color Theorem in Coq

description: |-
  This library contains a formal proof of the Four Color Theorem in Coq,
  along with the theories needed to support stating and then proving the Theorem.
  This includes an axiomatization of the setoid of classical real numbers,
  basic plane topology definitions, and a theory of combinatorial hypermaps.

  ## Building and installation instructions
  
  The easiest way to install the latest released version of The Four Color Theorem
  is via [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):
  
  ```shell
  opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
  opam install coq-fourcolor
  ```

  If you are only interested in the formalization of real numbers, you can install
  it separately:

  ```shell
  opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
  opam install coq-fourcolor-reals
  ```
  
  To instead build and install the whole project manually from the repository, do:
  
  ``` shell
  git clone https://github.com/coq-community/fourcolor.git
  cd fourcolor
  make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine> 
  make install
  ```

  ## Documentation

  The [Four Color Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem) (Appel & Haken, 1976) is a landmark result of graph theory.

  The formal proof is based on the [Mathematical Components](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp) library.
