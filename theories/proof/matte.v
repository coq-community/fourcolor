(* Mattes are finite sets of grid squares that are delimited by a simple grid *)
(* ring; we explicitly include the enumeration of the region and the ring.    *)
(* Mattes will be used to define conservative approximations of arbitrary     *)
(* connected open sets of points (regions). We therefore need to provide      *)
(* operations for extending a matte in order to improve the approximation.    *)
(* This involves three different operations :                                 *)
(*   - adding pixels within a specified rectangle that the matte meets, so    *)
(*     that a specific pixel is covered.                                      *)
(*   - adding the pixels surrounding a grid point of the matte boundary.      *)
(*   - refining the grid to ensure that the two previous operations are safe. *)
(* Note that we can't add a large rectangle blindly to a matte if we want to  *)
(* preserve its geometrical properties (we might end up with a disconnected   *)
(* contour). We reduce the first two operations above to two primitives that  *)
(* add a pixel that has exactly one or two consecutive sides in common with   *)
(* the matte, respectively (more precisely, 2 or 3 consecutive vertices in    *)
(* common with the matte contour vertices). We don't actually provide the     *)
(* second operation here, because it requires multiple grid refinements.      *)
(* Instead we provide a basic step that needs to be iterated to accomplish    *)
(* the operation, along with the metric ("matte_order") that decreases with   *)
(* that step.                                                                 *)
